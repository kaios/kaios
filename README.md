kaios64 v1.1
============

Small, customizable 64-bit Linux distribution aimed towards projects that need a small OS. Currently the initramfs and kernel are 14Mb. This project is the original KaiOS and has nothing to do with the phone operation system. Please do not contact me for any phone support. 

ATTENTION: Please note this is not the same KaiOS that is being used on mobile devices. The KaiOS that is found on mobile devices is a port of Firefox OS and is unrelated to this project.

Note:
PXE boot support only at this moment.
